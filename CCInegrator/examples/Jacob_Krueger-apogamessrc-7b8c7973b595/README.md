In this repository we contribute the sources for the Apo-Games Case Study accepted at the International Systems and Software Product Line Conference 2018 as challenge case.

Thus, if you use these artifacts as a case study, please cite the correpsonding paper:

* Jacob Krüger, Wolfram Fenske, Thomas Thüm, Dirk Aporius, Gunter Saake, Thomas Leich: Apo-Games - A Case Study for Reverse Engineering Variability from Cloned Java Variants. International Systems and Software Product Line Conference, 2018.

The pdf file of the submited case can be found on the SPLC website and is also provided in this repository. We will update these information regularly. The paper can also be found in Google Scholar.

There are some other works that use the Apo-Games and can provide a baseline for evaluations:

* Wolfram Fenske, Jens Meinicke, Sandro Schulze, Steffen Schulze, and Gunter Saake. Variant-Preserving Refactorings for Migrating Cloned Products to a Product Line. International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering, 2017.
* Jacob Krüger, Louis Nell, Wolfram Fenske, Gunter Saake, Thomas Leich: Finding Lost Features in Cloned Systems. International Systems and Software Product Line Conference, 2017.
* Crescencio Lima, Ivan Machado, Eduardo Almeida and Christina Chavez: Recovering the Product Line Architecture of the Apo-Games. International Systems and Software Product Line Conference, 2018.
* Willian D. F. Mendonça, Wesley K. G. Assunção and Lukas Linsbauer: Multi-Objective Optimization for Reverse Engineering of Apo-Games Feature Models. International Systems and Software Product Line Conference, 2018.

The Java folder contians the artifacts of 20 Java games that evolved from each other. The Android folder contains 5 games for the Android platform and the required BitEngine, which is not a clone of the other systems. 

All remaining folders contain the recent version of each project indlucing code, ressources, and mostly already compiled files.
